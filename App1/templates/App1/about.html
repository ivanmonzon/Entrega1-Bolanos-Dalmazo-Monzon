<h1 class="page-section-heading text-center text-uppercase text-secondary mb-0">About the Project</h1>
<br>
<h2 class="mb-5">
    Our project consisted in creating a website by using Python, Django, and a Bootstrap HTML template. We utilized different elements such as templates, forms, views, models in order to create a user friendly website in which you can sign up, login, modify your user, edit different objects, delete them, and log out.
    <br><br>
    Conceptually our website is about a record label in which user can browse through the different tabs and search for artist, instruments, record labels, and musical genres and know more each other. As well the user is able to edit this given the right permissions.
